# Create a password-protected Quarto website

This is a Quarto website template with password protection, using the 
[staticryptR](https://github.com/nikitoshina/staticryptR) package.

This will encrypt the rendered website and put it behind a simple password
prompt. It does not encrypt the source files, they will still be visible if they
are in a public repository, so this is likely most useful if the source files
are in a private repository but GitHub pages is set to be public (e.g., for 
[GitHub Enterprise Cloud users](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/changing-the-visibility-of-your-github-pages-site)).

Using staticryptR requires Node and the [staticrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt) 
Node library to be installed on your computer:

- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for your operating system.

In R:

- Install [staticryptR](https://github.com/nikitoshina/staticryptR)

    ```
    install.packages("staticryptR")
    ```

- Run the following to install the `staticrypt` Node library:

    ```
    staticrytR::install_staticrypt()
    ```

`encrypt.R` contains the script that will do the encryption. Set options and 
your password in that file (again note that this file will be visible if your 
repo is public). This script will be run automatically when the site is rendered
by `quarto render` or `quarto preview` - it is specified in the `post-render` 
paramater in `_quarto.yml`.

By default this template stores and encripts the rendered site in the `docs/`
directory in the main branch. To render to the `gh-pages` branch and publish
via a GitHub action, see the (currently in-progress) example at
[ateucher/quarto-private-test1](https://github.com/ateucher/quarto-private-test1), 
documentation for publishing on the [quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action).
